# Solar System Simulation

This project simulates the orbits of planets around the Sun using basic Newtonian mechanics. It includes:
- The Sun and 8 planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune).
- The Moon orbiting the Earth.
- A simple asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

The simulation is visualized in 3D using `matplotlib`.

## Features
- **Physics**: Uses Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation to calculate planetary motion.
- **3D Visualization**: Orbits are plotted in 3D space.
- **Customization**: Easily add more planets, moons, or asteroids.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib

```

How to Run

1.Clone this repository or download the code.

2.Navigate to the project directory.

3.Run the script:

```bash
python solar_system.py

```

The simulation will generate a 3D plot and save it as solar_system_plot.png in the output_images folder.
